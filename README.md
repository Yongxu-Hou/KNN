# KNN
KNN algorithm implemented using Python(3.6)
## Project Introduction
k-nearest neighbor(k-NN) is a kind of basic classification and regression method, it actually use training dataset to dividide 
feature vector space and viewd it as a classification model. 
KNN has three basic elements: the value of k, distance metric and classification decision rule.
Code we implement can divided into six steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Open the dataset from CSV and split into test/train datasets.
- Similarity: Calculate the distance between two instances.
- Neighbors: Find k-nereast neigbor for query instance.
- Response: Generate a response from a set of data instances.
- Accuracy: Compute the accuracy of predictions.
- Main: Tie it all together.
